About QuantConnect
==================


Since 2012, we have worked passionately to break open access to powerful technology for individuals, giving them the framework, data, and infrastructure to compete in algorithmic trading. Never before has the playing field been so level and rife with opportunities for those who want to pursue quantitative finance. We now have billions in live trading volumes on LEAN (our open-source desktop-cloud hybrid algorithmic trading platform), regular sponsored competitions, and Alpha being licensed from the community. It is a true meritocracy, with the best and brightest from all over the world building off of each other in the QuantConnect community.
